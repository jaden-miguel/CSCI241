CSCI241: Data Structures

* Design and implementation of hash tables, general trees, search trees, balanced trees and graphs. Comparison of sorting algorithms. Demonstration of the use of data structures in various applications. Evaluation of the best data structure for a particular task. Programming is required in implementation of concepts.

At the end of this course, students will have:

* Basic understanding of classic data structures including trees, hash tables and graphs.
* Basic understanding of various sorting algorithms.
* Thorough understanding of recursion in definition and operations in these data structures.
* The ability to select and design the proper data structures to problems requiring complex data structures (combinations of lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables).
* The ability to select the proper sorting algorithms for a problem.
* The ability to make judgments about the selected data structures for a problem.
* The ability to implement the introduced data structures and sorting algorithms.
